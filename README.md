# Project Title: Gesture-Controlled Alert System using Flex Sensors
Introduction:

This Arduino-based project utilizes flex sensors to create a gesture-controlled alert system. The system is designed to detect hand movements and gestures, providing specific alerts based on the detected gestures. It is particularly helpful for mute individuals to communicate essential needs in real-time.

Working:

The system comprises four flex sensors, each assigned to different gestures. The flex sensors provide analog input based on the bending of fingers.

Upon receiving input from the sensors, the Arduino board processes the data and determines the corresponding gesture. If a specific gesture is recognized, the system triggers an appropriate alert. For example, bending one finger might indicate a need for food, while another gesture could signify a request for water.

Description:

This project demonstrates how advanced sensor technologies can be integrated to enhance communication and accessibility. It aims to empower mute individuals by enabling them to express their needs effortlessly through gestures.

Components Used: Arduino UNO Four Flex Sensors Gesture-Alert Mapping: Flex Sensor 1: Food Alert Flex Sensor 2: Water Alert Flex Sensor 3: Help Alert Flex Sensor 4: Custom Alert (Can be programmed for a specific need) Instructions: Connect the flex sensors to the Arduino board as specified in the initial comments of the code. Upload the provided code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE. Calibrate the flex sensors , using the "checkSettings()" function in the code. Power up the system and wear the glove equipped with the flex sensors. As you bend your fingers or make specific hand movements, the system will recognize gestures and trigger corresponding alerts. Note: The sensitivity of flex sensors can be adjusted as needed. Customize the custom alert (Gesture assigned to Flex Sensor 4) for specific user requirements.
